- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Personally this is one of my most favorite assignments in this course. I liked how the different classes connected to the building class through "extend". I thought it was interesting how these classes all connected but within each class there were very different tasks asked of us. I thought I was able to build off the last assignment and my understanding of what was required for credit in that assignment. Although I liked this assignment I would be worried about making my own Inheritance tree. 

When I had an error in the Hashtable, specifically with the library class, I was able to resolve in talking to the professor and understanding that Hashtable is not the same as String. I got very stuck in the checkOut part of this assignment but was able to resolve it in thinking about Hashtable more as an ArrayList. 

What worked was working in the order of the assignment and working down the list - I felt like the assignment got more complicated as I got farther into the assignment. Reading the assignment very closely was super helpful in completing this assignment and referring to both the past asssignment and slides from class. Working through the first part in class was also helpful in getting started and flowing with the assignment.
